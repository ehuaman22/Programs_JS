Programs JS

In JavaScript or TypeScript, write a program that parses a word and returns the word with the following: first letter, number of distinct characters between first and last character, and last letter. For example, Smooth would become S3h. Words can only be composed of alphabetic characters. A few of the things we will be looking at are test scenarios including negative tests, code accuracy, and solution completeness.
